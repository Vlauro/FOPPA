# FOPPA
The FOPPA ontology standardizes photogrammetric documentation of archaeological artifacts, integrating CIDOC standards. Version 4_2, an evolution of the BeA-PG protocol, is now obsolete and archived for reference.

The FOPPA ontology is a comprehensive framework designed to standardize and enhance the photogrammetric documentation of archaeological artifacts. It is meticulously structured into classes and properties that encapsulate the various phases of the photogrammetric process, from initial data acquisition to final export. The ontology is deeply integrated with the CIDOC CRM and CIDOC-CRMsci standards, ensuring a consistent and interoperable approach to cultural heritage documentation.

Version 4_2 of the FOPPA ontology is now considered obsolete and will be maintained solely for archival purposes. This version, FOPPA 4_2, continues the development of the BeA-PG protocol, of which it is an evolution.

At the heart of the FOPPA ontology are four main phases: Acquisition, Processing, Modeling, and Exporting. Each phase is further divided into sub-phases, each represented by specific classes and properties. For instance, the Acquisition phase includes classes such as Raw Data Metadata, while the Processing phase encompasses classes like Point Cloud Processing and Densified Point Cloud. These classes are designed to capture detailed metadata about the photogrammetric process, including the software used, algorithms applied, and quality of the output.

The ontology also includes classes for the Modeling phase, such as Mesh Reconstruction and Mesh Texturing, which document the creation and refinement of 3D models. The final phase, Exporting, includes classes that record the preparation and dissemination of the final model, whether it be for 3D printing, video presentation, or interactive exhibition.

The FOPPA ontology serves multiple purposes: it provides a standardized approach to photogrammetric documentation, ensures high-quality data capture and processing, and facilitates the interoperability of data within the broader context of cultural heritage research. By adhering to international standards and incorporating detailed procedural guidelines from the FOPPA manual, the ontology supports accurate and reliable digital preservation of archaeological artifacts.
